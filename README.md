# Welcome to Kolibri Alternative User Interface

Here you can find all information about the new Kolibri front-end created by the BongoCats team.

## Who we are? 

BongoCats - a team of two young front-end developers from Ukraine who started their programming trip in Tezos Ukraine. Meet Alexandr Petrenko and Alexey Altyntsev. We are ambitious, flexible, curious, and ready for new challenges.

## What we have done? 

### New Design:

Our main idea was to create something new and at the same time all-too-familiar. Here you can view both desktop and mobile versions.

### Light/Dark mode:

We have implemented two themes on our product. Now, you can choose between light and dark mode. This is very useful when the sun goes down, as it reduces the light emitted by device screens while maintaining the minimum color contrast ratios required for readability.

That is how it looks like:

### Internationalization:

Internationalization provides an opportunity to make the Kolibri more worldwide and user-oriented. At the moment we've implemented EN and UA options.
Example:

### Push Notifications:

Sometimes you need to make a transaction, but Oracle last updated more than 30 minutes ago. In this case, you are stuck. Well, our idea is that you don't need to monitor the website, just tick the bell and leave it open. As result, when Oracle update the price, you'll get such browser notification:

## What are we going to implement? 

### More Notifications

Notifications are useful for being up-to-date with Kolibri. We also want to implement notifications for changes in kUSD price and critical changes in your ovens. Also, we think about mail notifications implementation.
